# Rules
The program randomly generates n digits, and the player's role is to guess the digits in correct order. 
Everytime the program will indicate how many digits match - correct numbers in the correct positions - and how many digits hit 
- correct numbers in incorrect positions. 
If the player can figure out the n digits in m rounds, then player wins; otherwise, computer wins.
